# STAT110

This is a blog where I am forcing myself to take notes as I read through and watch the online lectures for Introduction to Probability by Blitzstein and Hwang. I'm also using it as a way to get more familiar with Jekyll and using Jekyll in GitHub Pages.

I'm using the [Kiko](http://github.com/gfjaru/Kiko) theme for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), as a starting point and am working on customizing it to my needs for the site. For example, I've added front matter to the post template that, when present, will embed the youtube video for the lecture I am discussing at the top of the post.
