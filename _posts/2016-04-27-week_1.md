## 1.1 Why study probability?

> Probability is the logic of uncertainty.

The gist of it is that probability is used in a wide variety of fields: statistics, science, computer science, political science, etc. He makes the exact same joke in his lecture as he does in the book about mentioning finance and gambling being repeating himself.

It mentions that they will be using simulations as a way to reinforce ideas from the book. I'm looking forward to that. I've always been fasninated with things like that. I've got websites from 15+ years ago were I wrote lottery simulations, poker simulations, coin-flip simulations, etc. Actually, the very first full-fledged program that I wrote myself, as a final project, for Super Saturday at Purdue when I was in 6th grade (25 years ago) was a coin-flipping simulation written in BASIC.

## Sample spaces and Pebble World

This section introduces __sets__ and defines a few new terms related to sets. It then uses several examples to reinforce these concepts.

sample space
: The set of all possible outcomes of an experiment

event
: An event is a subset of a sample space. For example, drawing an ace from a deck of cards would be an event that occured if any of the 4 aces were drawn.
