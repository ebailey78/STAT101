title: Getting Started

<p>
  I'm going to attempt to teach myself the basics of probability by working my way through <a href = "http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Probability-Chapman-Statistical-Science/dp/1466575573/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1461808075&sr=8-2&keywords=Introduction+to+probability" target = "_blank">Introduction to Probability</a> by Joseph K. Blitzstein and Jessica Hwang. The book has a <a href = "http://projects.iq.harvard.edu/stat110" target = "_blank">companion site</a> with links to lecture videos, handouts and additional materials.
</p>

  The plan is to try to tackle a chapter a week. That is probably a bit optimistic but we will see how it goes.
