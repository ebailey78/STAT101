## 1.1 Why study probability?

> Probability is the logic of uncertainty.

The gist of it is that probability is used in a wide variety of fields: statistics, science, computer science, political science, etc. He makes the exact same joke in his lecture as he does in the book about mentioning finance and gambling being repeating himself.

It mentions that they will be using simulations as a way to reinforce ideas from the book. I'm looking forward to that. I've always been fasninated with randomization and simulation. I've got websites from 15+ years ago when I was teaching myself javascript where I wrote lottery simulations, poker simulations, coin-flip simulations, etc. Actually, the very first full-fledged program that I wrote myself, as a final project for Super Saturday at Purdue when I was in 6th grade (25 years ago) was a coin-flipping simulation written in BASIC. The simulations will be focused on R, a programming language that I'm already pretty good at so it should be fun.

## 1.2 Sample spaces and Pebble World

This section introduces __sets__ and defines a few new terms related to sets. It then uses several examples to reinforce these concepts.

sample space
: The set of all possible outcomes of an experiment

event
: An event is a subset of a sample space. For example, drawing an ace from a deck of cards would be an event that occured if any of the 4 aces were drawn (4 outcomes, 1 event).

The pebble world is a visualization technique that encourages you to look at the sample space as a world populated by a bunch of identical pebbles. In this world, each pebble is equally likely to be selected and represents an potential _outcome_. That makes an _event_ be a group of pebbles. The ratio of pebbles in an event to the total number of pebbles becomes the probability of that event occuring. This visualization requires that two assumptions be true:

* There is a finite number of outcomes (pebbles) in the sample space and
* Each outcome is equally likely.

The section goes on the introduce some additional nomenclature:

union (\`uu\`)
: If A and B are two events:  A &cup; B includes any outcome where A or B occurs. 

intersection (~ nn + :- 4xx3=12 ~)
: If A and B are two events: ~AnnB~ includes any outcome where A and B both occur. If A is drawing a Club from a deck of cards and B is drawing an Ace from the same deck of cards, A &cap; B would be drawing the Ace of Clubs.

compliment (<sup>c</sup>)
: If A is an event, A<sup>c</sup> is every outcome where A doesn't occur. For the example above, A is drawing a Club from a deck of cards, A<sup>c</sup> would be drawing a Heart, Spade, or Diamond.

### De Morgan's Laws

> (A&cup;B)<sup>c</sup> = A<sup>c</sup>&cap;B<sup>c</sup>
> (A&cap;B)<sup>c</sup> = A<sup>c</sup>&cup;B<sup>c</sup>

This law says that the compliment of the union of two events is the same as the intersection of the two events' compliments. Similarly, the compliment of the intersection of two events is the same as the union of the two events' compliments. Now to try to put this is terms that actually make sense to me.

We will stick with A being drawing a Club from a deck of cards and B being drawing an Ace. A&cup;B would be drawing any Club or Ace. The compliment of that would be drawing any non-Club that also isn't an Ace. A<sup>c</sup> would be drawing any non-Club. B<sup>c</sup> would be drawing any non-Ace. The intersection of those would also be any non-Club that is also a non-Ace.

For the second one: A&cap;B would be drawing the Ace of Clubs. The compliment of that would be drawing anything but the Ace of Clubs. Again, the compliment of A would be drawing a non-Club and the compliment of B is drawing any non-Ace. The union of those would cover drawing anything but the Ace of Clubs.
